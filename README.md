# CMPS203-ProgrammingLanguages
** What to study **
- Different paradigms  
  - Mix and match within/between languages
  - Computational models
    - Imperative, functional, “logical”, event-based
  - Abstract machines
- Key concepts and implementation techniques
  - Scopes (name space and memory management)
  - Type system; type checking and inference
  - Data abstraction; polymorphism
  - Objects (and classes)
  - Modularity
  - Concurrency
  - Mobility (?)
- Foundational formalisms, calculi, theories
  - Predicate calculus, (typed) lambda calculus, multi-sorted algebras;
  - (higher-order) abstract syntax
  - Denotational, axiomatic, operational semantics
